These are the JavaScript solutions to the Codecademy code challenges 
available on https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/essential-information-on-code-challenges/83909

The intent with this is not to simply provide answers but share the challenges I faced 
when attempting these problems.
Every file contains details comments on what methods I attempted and why they didn't work. 

These questions are drawn from real-world developer job interviews 
and are a low stress way to gauge how prepared you are for a prospective interview.

A good benchmark to set for yourself would be to aim to solve these in less than 30 minutes 
without the aid of the internet as much as possible.

Good luck!
